      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.<br>
        The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
        <br>The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
        <br>To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
